##### What are the way by which we can create object in JavaScript ?

**Method 1:** `Function Based`

If we want to create several similar `objects`. In below code sample, `Employee` which is called *constructor function*. This is similar to classes in object oriented languages.

```javascript

  function Employee(fName, lName, age, salary){
    this.firstName = fName;
    this.lastName = lName;
    this.age = age;
    this.salary = salary;
  }

  // Creating multiple object which have similar property but diff value assigned to object property.
  var employee1 = new Employee('John', 'Moto', 24, '5000$');
  var employee1 = new Employee('Ryan', 'Jor', 26, '3000$');
  var employee1 = new Employee('Andre', 'Salt', 26, '4000$');
```

**Method 2:** `Object Literal`

Object Literal is best way to create an object and this is used frequently. Below is code sample for create employee object which contains property as well as method.

```javascript
var employee = {
  name : 'Nishant',
  salary : 245678,
  getName : function(){
    return this.name;
  }
}
```
Below code sample is Nested Object Literal, Here address is an object inside employee object.

```javascript
var employee = {
  name : 'Nishant',
  salary : 245678,
  address : {
    addressLine1 : 'BITS Pilani',
    addressLine2 : 'Vidya Vihar'.
    phoneNumber: {
      workPhone: 7098889765,
      homePhone: 1234567898
    }
  }
}
```
**Method 3:** `Using JavaScript new keyword`

In below code sample object has been created using Object constructor function.

```javascript
var employee = new Object(); // Created employee object using new keywords and Object()
employee.name = 'Nishant';
employee.getName = function(){
  return this.name;
}
```
**Note:** As a best practices object literal way is used to create object over this method.
