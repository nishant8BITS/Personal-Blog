##### Best way to detect `undefined` object property in JavaScript.

> Suppose we have given an object `person`

```javascript
var person = {
  name: 'Nishant',
  age : 24
}
```
Here the `person` object has a `name` and `age` property. Now we are trying to access the **salary** property which we haven't declared on the person object so while accessing it will return undefined. So how we will ensure whether property is undefined or not before performing some operation over it?

**Explanation:**

We can use `typeof` operator to check undefined

```javascript
if(typeof someProperty === 'undefined'){
  console.log('something is undefined here');
}
```
Now we are trying to access salary property of person object.

```javascript
if(typeof person.salary === 'undefined'){
  console.log("salary is undefined here because we haven't declared");
}
```
