##### What is Strict mode in JavaScript ?.

> ECMAScript 5 introduced the concept of *strict mode*. 

**Invoking Strict Mode in Code**

Strict mode applies to entire scripts or to individual function. It doesn’t apply to block statement enclosed in {} braces, attempting to apply it to such contexts does nothing.

**Entire Script:**

Let say we are creating app.js so adding first statement use script will enforce strict mode for entire code.

```javascript
// app.js whole script in strict mode syntax
“use strict”;
// Now you can start writing your code 
``` 

**Strict mode for function:** 

To Invoke strict mode for a function, put the exact statement “use strict”; in the start of function body before any other statement.

```javascript
function yourFunc(){
 "use strict";

 // Your function code logic
}
``` 

Strict mode incorporate several changes to normal Javascript semantics. First strict mode eliminate some JavaScript silent error by changing them to throw errors.

**For Instance: Code using Strict Mode**

In above code example without using strict mode in code It won't throw an error. As we are accessing variable `x` without declaring it. So in strict mode accessing undeclared variable throw an error.

Now let's try to access variable x without declaring it without strict mode.

```javascript
(function(){
	x = 3;
})();

// Will not throw an error
``` 

**Advantage of using strict mode:**

* Eliminate JavaScript silent errors by throwing error.
* Fixes mistake that make it difficult for JavaScript engine to perform optimisation.
* Make code run faster sometime than identical code that’s not in strict mode
* Prohibits some syntax likely to be defined in future version of ECMAScript.

>*What happens if browser doesn’t support strict mode ?*

When browser does’t support the strict mode directive then it simply ignored by javascript engine.
