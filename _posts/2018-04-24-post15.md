title: React Advantage & Disadvantage ?

## React Advantage

1.  Readability
2.  Maintainability
3.  Isomorphic (Server Side Rendering)
4.  Easier Debugging & Development & Developer Friendly
5.  Reusability
6.  Testability
7.  Performance (Virtual Dom) - Enable building Highly Dynamic UI Interactive page
    
    Real and Virtual DOMs
    
    This makes updates really quick, allowing for the building of a highly dynamic UI. We can notice it writing in Facebook chat and seeing a simultaneously updating news feed. Moreover, in ReactJS, developers donâ€™t have to bind DOM to functionality in the front-end because React elements are already connected to it.
    
    The approach enabled developers to work with UI-objects faster and use hot reloading (applying changes in a real-time mode). Not only did it increase performance, it also made programming faster
    

## React Disadvantage

1.  React is View layer, You still have to plug Business logic part and Data manipulation part like redux
2.  Hierarchy Data navigation (Data Sharing among sibling is a bit complex you have to use Context or Some State Management Library like Redux) In traditional way If you want to pass some data among (indirect) sibling then you have to pass it via parent which is cumbersome.
3.  You won't allowed to pass method as a props. (Kind of Restricting one of the best feature of JavaScript in which Function is treated as first class citizen and can be pass as smilier to primitive data type)
4.  Require Handling Business & Navigation logic explicitly
