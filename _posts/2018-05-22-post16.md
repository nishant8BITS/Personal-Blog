title: Higher order Functions ?
---

HOF let you use function as data, allowing for FP's most powerful patterns.

A function that takes and/or returns another function is called a higher-order function. It’s “higher-order” because it operates on functions, in addition to strings, numbers, arrays, etc. Pretty meta.

> Functions let us communicate code through actions, allowing for more meaningful and comprehensible discussions.

Function is a also treated as Data Type in JavaScript (Why)

1.  You can pass them to other functions
2.  Set them as object properties
3.  Store them in arrays
4.  Set them as variables
5.  Return them from other functions

Why Abstraction ?

Our lives revolve around abstraction–the practice of making complex things easier to increase productivity. HOFs can abstract us away from step-by-step procedures, instead opting for readable, reusable functions everywhere.

### Abstracting Over Actions
Abstraction’s a fundamental CS concept that makes us all more productive. A good abstractions let us focus on getting things done without sweating implementation details.
