### What is JavaScript Self-Invoking anonymous function or Self-Executing anonymous function.
A `self-invoking` anonymous function also called `self-executing anonymous function` runs immediately or automatically when we define it and self-invoking anonymous function doesn't have any name at all. Self-Invoking anonymous function syntax:

```javascript
(function() {
  console.log("Self-Invoking function code logic ");
})();
Output: Self-Invoking function code logic
```

We must have to know the fact that JavaScript functions run immediately when we put `()` after their names.

```javascript
function display() {
  console.log("Display me");
}
display();  // This will run immediately

Output: "Display me"
/*
This will not run immediately as we haven't put () after function
name, function name is use full when we want to pass it as
callback to another function or method.
*/
display;

function testCallBack(callback) {
  callback ();  // This will be call display method immediately if callback parameter is being set method display
}
testCallBack(display); // Here display function is being passed as callback
```
