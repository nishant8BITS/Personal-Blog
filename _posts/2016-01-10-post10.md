title: What would be the output of the following code?
---

```javascript
function User(name) {
  this.name = name || "JsGeeks";
}

var person = new User("xyz")["location"] = "USA";
console.log(person);
```

The output of above code would be `USA`. Here `new User("xyz")` creates a brand new object and created property `location` on that and `USA` has been assigned to object property location and that has been referenced by the person.

Let say `new User("xyz")` crated a object called `foo` and returned now `foo["location"]` would be assigned value as `USA` and `person` is referencing to `foo["location"]`.
