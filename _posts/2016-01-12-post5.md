##### Write a function called deepClone which takes an object and creates a object copy of it.

``` javascript
var newObject = deepClone(obj);
```
Solution:

```javascript
function deepClone(object){
  var newObject = {};
  for(var key in object){
    if(typeof object[key] === 'object'){
     newObject[key] = deepClone(object[key]);
    }else{
     newObject[key] = object[key];
    }
  }
  return newObject;
}
```

**Explanation:** We have been asked to do deep copy of object so What's basically it's mean ??. Let's understand in this way you have been given an object `personalDetail` this object contains some property which again a type of object here as you can see `address` is an object and `phoneNumber` in side an `address` is also an object. In simple term `personalDetail` is nested object(object inside object). So Here deep copy means we have to copy all the property of `personalDetail` object including nested object.

```javascript
var personalDetail = {
  name : 'Nishant',
  address : {
    location: 'xyz',
    zip : '123456',
    phoneNumber : {
      homePhone: 8797912345,
      workPhone : 1234509876
    }
  }
}
```
So when we do deep clone then we should copy every property (including the nested object).
